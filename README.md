# File Management System

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a file management system that allows users to manage files and directories. The system provides functionalities for creating, organizing, and manipulating files and directories within a structured format. This project is designed to gain experience with non-linear data structures and the design and implementation of recursive algorithms in Java.

## Features
- **File Management**: Create, read, update, and delete files and directories.
- **Exception Handling**: Handle exceptions specific to file operations.
- **Custom Components**: Utilize custom components for file management interface.
- **Sorting and Comparisons**: Sort files and directories using custom comparators.
- **Linked Data Structures**: Manage files and directories using linked lists.
- **Printing File Structure**: Print the structure of the file system.

## Provided Files
- **ControlPanel.java**: Manages the control panel interface for the file management system.
- **FileObject.java**: Represents a file object within the system.
- **FileObjectException.java**: Custom exception class for handling file object errors.
- **FileStructure.java**: Manages the structure of files and directories.
- **FileSystem.java**: Main class managing file system operations.
- **ListNodes.java**: Manages linked list nodes for storing file objects.
- **MyTextArea.java**: Custom text area component for displaying file contents.
- **NameComparator.java**: Comparator class for sorting files and directories by name.
- **NLNode.java**: Node class for managing linked list of file objects.
- **PrintFileStructure.java**: Class for printing the file structure.
- **SizeComparator.java**: Comparator class for sorting files and directories by size.
- **SplitPanel.java**: Manages the split panel interface for the file management system.
- **SuffixComparator.java**: Comparator class for sorting files and directories by suffix.

## Installation
